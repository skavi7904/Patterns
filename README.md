# Patterns Problem Solving in Java

Welcome to the Patterns Problem Solving repository! This repository contains a collection of Java programs aimed at solving various pattern-based problems. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about loops and conditionals or an advanced coder seeking to refine your skills, you'll find valuable resources here.

## Contents

- **Introduction to Patterns**: Basic explanations and examples of different types of patterns.
- **Simple Patterns**: Programs to create basic patterns such as squares, triangles, and diamonds.
- **Complex Patterns**: More advanced patterns including pyramids, Pascal's triangles, and number-based patterns.
- **Star Patterns**: A variety of star-based patterns ranging from simple to intricate designs.
- **Number Patterns**: Patterns involving numerical sequences and arrangements.
- **Alphabet Patterns**: Patterns that use letters of the alphabet to create interesting designs.

## Patterns Implemented

1. **Square of Stars** (Method: `n1`)
2. **Right-angled Triangle of Stars** (Method: `n2`)
3. **Right-angled Triangle of Numbers** (Method: `n3`)
4. **Right-angled Triangle with Repeated Numbers** (Method: `n4`)
5. **Inverted Right-angled Triangle of Stars** (Method: `n5`)
6. **Inverted Right-angled Triangle of Numbers** (Method: `n6`)
7. **Pyramid of Stars** (Method: `n7`)
8. **Inverted Pyramid of Stars** (Method: `n8`)
9. **Combined Pyramid and Inverted Pyramid of Stars** (Method: `n9`)
10. **Diamond of Stars** (Method: `n10`)
11. **Binary Triangle** (Method: `n11`)
12. **Symmetrical Number Triangle** (Method: `n12`)
13. **Incremental Numbers Triangle** (Method: `n13`)
14. **Alphabet Triangle** (Method: `n14`)
15. **Inverted Alphabet Triangle** (Method: `n15`)
16. **Repeated Alphabets Triangle** (Method: `n16`)
